Madina is a library to simplify the creation of workflows for urban planning
research. Powered by `GeoPandas <https://geopandas.org/en/stable/>`_ and other
Python packages, we provide tools to work with geometry, networks, and
geoprocessing.

To start, navigate through our tutorials starting from the 
:doc:`installation guide<tutorial/installation>` through the guide to calculate
pedestrian betweenness on urban networks in the 
:doc:`betweenness guide<tutorial/betweenness>`.
