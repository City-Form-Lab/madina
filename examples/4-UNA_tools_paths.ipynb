This is done by finding the shortest path between each node, and all other nodes in the graph, and for each edge, calculating the ratio of paths that pass through that edge to the total number of paths. While this metric is a good indicator of segment centrality and importance, it doesn't account for many charateristics of urban transport networks: \n",

    "## Notes on performance. \n",
    "Testing on an personal computer with 8 cores, The running time was 9 seconds on a single core, and 5 seconds when using 2 cores. There is some overhead to prepare data and aggrigate results when doing multiprocessing, so the time savings are not completely linear. The benifit for multiprocessing increases as the number of origins increases, and the number of used cores increas, causing the overhead operations to be shared by a larger number of origins. In a larger urban setting, with a more complicated network and a larger number of origins and destinations, performance becomes very important. Here are a few recommendations to enhance performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use multiprocessing: The more origin you have in your analysis area, the more time savings you get from multiprocessing\n",
    "* Simplify the network: A street centerline has less segments than a sidewalk network. Sidewalk network offer a more realistic representation of the pedestrian trip making experience, but lead to more running times. Consider cleaning out the network to eliminate any unneccissaey segments, or as mentioned in section 2, try to eliminate degree-2 intersections whenever you can. \n",
    "* Consider aggregating origins or destinations: While the current version is capable of handling larger numbers of origins and destinations, in large analysis zones, or in cases where you need to run a larger number of scenarios, consider a spatial resulution that is appropriate for your analysis that doesn't lead to significiant accuracy cost. For example, consider clustering origins and destinations on the same side of the street segment into fewer pouints by clustering them evry 40 meters for example. Make sure to assign weights that reflect how many points belong to the cluster, and their importance. \n",
    "* Use a resonable search radius and a detour ratio: A high detour ration leads to generating larger numbers of alternative paths. consider setting this parameter to the lowesr possible value to significiantly increase performance. A lower search radius also leads to performance gains. COnsider setting a realistic search radius, especially if decay is enabled. as further destinations are already heavily penalized and constitute a smaller fraction of the trip generation."
